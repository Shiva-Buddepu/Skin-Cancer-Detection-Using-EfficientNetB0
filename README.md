# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using-EfficientNetB0

Developed a deep learning model to detect skin cancer from medical images. Addressed an unbalanced dataset using data augmentation techniques like rotation, flipping, and scaling to balance class distribution. Trained and fine-tuned the EfficientNetB0 model, achieving high accuracy in classifying skin cancer types
